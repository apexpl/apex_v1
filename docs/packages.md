# Packages and Upgrades

Apex has a very modular design, and each system is comprised of a series of packages allowing you to customize
and finely tune each system to its specific needs without having a bulky system that contains functionality
that is not needed.  All packages have the same basic structure, allowing them to be instantly installed /
removed, and simply work without any additional effort.
