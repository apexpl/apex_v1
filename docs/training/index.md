# Training Guide

This guide serves to take you through the basic aspects of developing quality online software operations with Apex,
as quickly and efficiently as possible.  Instead of doing a standard "Hello World" app, we'll do something a
little more real world, and develop a quick online lottery operation, where every 24 hours a user is randomly picked and paid out 
an amount defined by the administrator.

If desired, you may download the completed training project by installing the "training" package into your Apex installation.  In termal, simply type:

`php apex.php install training`
